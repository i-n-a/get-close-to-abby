    Developer Notes:
    ==================    
    
    Can we use PubNub for chat rooms?

    Learnings:
    - PubNub is a real-time messaging service that can be used for chat rooms.
    - PubNub provides a JavaScript SDK that can be used to create chat rooms.
    - PubNub allows you to subscribe to channels and publish messages to channels.
    - PubNub provides a way to manage chat rooms and users.
    - See Figjam file for more details: https://www.figma.com/board/vT4THCcwrIsUxfunAO2sty/Integration4?node-id=417-4656&t=IsTfs76dR1NZEAeI-4
    
    Solution:
    - Use PubNub to create a simple chat room application.
    - 2 chatrooms are created: "room-a" and "room-b".
    - Like in Supabase, you need to have 2 keys: publish and subscribe keys. Then you can use them to connect to PubNub.
    - You first subscribe to a room, then you can send messages to that room. You can mimick a conversation by open this page in 2 different tabs or browsers.

    ‼️ Limitations:
    - Quick prototype test for PubNub chat rooms.
    - This is a simple test to check if PubNub can be used for chat rooms. You can switch between rooms and send messages.
    - This is not a full implementation, just a quick test to see if PubNub can be used for chat rooms.
    - You can switch between rooms and send messages to the new room. But the messages will disappear when you switch rooms.
