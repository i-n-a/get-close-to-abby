    ==================    
    
    Database Ticket Print Test:
    Does the printer print a ticket using live data fetched from the database?

    Problem: 
      - The ticket is still hard-coded. In real life scenario, there is a database that holds the close-images and room prompts.

    Learnings:
      - Leverage React + Supabase for speed, built-in tools, and modern dev flow. 
      - Supabase covers backend for you => Supabase is BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service).
      - By using other libraries like pdfmake or jsPDF, you can generate PDFs directly in the browser without needing a Node.js backend.
      - Grayscaling the supabase close up images are done with a helper function that uses the browsers canvas API in js.
      - Now you don't need a server running to generate the ticket anymore.
    
    Solution:
    - Dev Setup: 
      - front-end will be react in vite (+ gsap later added for interactions) 
      - supabase for database
      - there is no back-end anymore. 2 other pdf generating js libraries are tested 
      - grayscaling the supabase close up images are done with a helper function that uses the browsers canvas API in js 

    ‼️ Limitations:
    - You need to have a default printer set up on your Mac for this to work.
    - The printer needs to support double-sided printing, otherwise it will print each page separately.
