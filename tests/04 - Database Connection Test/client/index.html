    Developer Notes:
    ==================    
    
    Database Connection Test:
    Can the app connect to the database and successfully retrieve ticket data?

    Problem: 
      - The ticket is still hard-coded. In real life scenario, there is a database that holds the close-images and room clue prompts.

    Learnings:
      - Leverage React + Supabase for speed, built-in tools, and modern dev flow. 
      - Supabase covers backend for you => Supabase is BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service).
    
    Solution:
    - Dev Setup: 
      - front-end will be react in vite (+ gsap later added for interactions) 
      - supabase for database
      - back-end will be added again later to use pdf generation and sharp image process library ( = node.js (+ express?) for pdf generation and sharp image process library)

    ‼️ Limitations:
    - This test is only a basic connection test to the database.
    - It will download a ticket.txt file with the data cominf from the database, which is the clue text and the close-up image URL.
