# Welcome to Get Close to Abby!
This is the code for the "Get Close to Abby" site, built by Inge, Melisa, Tom and Kristina.

## Goal:
Invite visitors to engage creatively with the Abby cultural space in Kortrijk.

## Concept Summary
Abby is not just a physical space. It’s a place for connection, creativity, and co-creation.
The site supports an open call campaign where visitors are invited to discover hidden details in the space and respond to them through creative submissions. This website is just a fraction of the touchpoints designed for this concept. Look at our Figjam to see it all!
